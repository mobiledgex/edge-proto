# EdgeProto

The EdgeProto library defines Protocol Buffers definitions and APIs for communication between mobile devices and the Edge-Cloud platform. Specifically, these APIs are served by the Edge-Cloud's Distributed Matching Engine (DME).

These Protocol Buffer data structures and APIs are used by the go-code based Edge-Cloud platform repository as the server-side, and the various Android, IOS, Unity, and other device-based SDK repositories as the client-side.
